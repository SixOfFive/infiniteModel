# InfiniteModel changelog

A capability-level summary of how the engine came together. (The original repo tracked changes at
per-commit granularity in `server.py` / `client.py` `VERSION` tags; this public history starts from a
single squashed commit, so the detail below is grouped by milestone rather than by commit.)

## Distributed core
- Node registry + heartbeat + capability probe; live dashboard; RAM/VRAM-weighted partition planner.
- **Pipeline parallelism** over a hand-rolled plain-TCP transport (Windows + Linux): each worker holds
  a contiguous layer range; weights are **chunk-served** from the controller straight into worker RAM
  (no model on worker disk, no temp files).
- Incremental **KV-cache decode** (prefill-once, flat per-token cost); networked generation with full
  Ollama / OpenAI / Anthropic-compatible API surface.
- **Tensor parallelism** within a stage — capacity-proportional, GPU+CPU mixed meshes, KV-head
  replication; in-place reconfigure between pipeline and TP.
- **Speculative decoding** (opt-in, greedy-exact) — draft proposes K tokens, the pipeline verifies in
  one traversal; wins on big/distributed targets (measured).

## Memory, quantization & the shard cache
- **int4** (group-wise asymmetric, fused tinygemm GEMM) and **int8** (per-channel) load-time quant;
  serve-time dequant of **fp8** and **nvfp4** checkpoints.
- GPU-first placement that always fits (spill to CPU/RAM), full-context KV pre-reservation, coexistence
  budgets, and OOM-safe replans (cgroup caps, honest transient accounting).
- **Pre-compiled shard cache** — the controller quantizes a model once to `_shards/<quant>/`; loads
  then serve small **pre-packed** int4/int8 layers (skip the bf16 stream + re-quantize). Covers dense,
  fused-3D MoE, and per-expert MoE (Mixtral/OLMoE, fused at compile) — bit-identical to a cold load.
- **Distributed packing** (exo-inspired) — the per-layer pack fans out across the fleet's idle CPUs:
  each worker fetches a layer's bf16, packs it with the *shared* packer (and, for per-expert MoE, fuses
  to 3D against a meta skeleton it rebuilds from the model config), and posts it back. Bit-identical to
  a single-box compile by construction (the same shared fuse + pack code), proven per-layer by a byte
  comparison, with automatic local fallback on any worker failure.

## Models
- **MoE**: fused + non-fused experts; optional intra-layer offload (attention on GPU, routed experts in
  CPU RAM). Loaded + validated across Mixtral, OLMoE, Qwen3-MoE / Qwen3.6-A3B, MiniMax-M2.
- **Multimodal**: distributed vision + audio (Qwen2.5-Omni) — image/audio → text, 3D mRoPE positions.
- Hybrid architectures (Gated-DeltaNet + mRoPE), multimodal text-config models, and a range of dense
  decoders (Qwen2.5/3, Llama, Mistral/Devstral, DeepSeek).

## Multi-model & ops
- N models resident at once, per-node sharing, concurrency + queueing, auto-load/unload, same-model
  replication + data-parallel routing.
- Robust loads: survive a worker drop mid-load (replan on survivors), free partial shards on failure,
  scaled timeouts, gentler restarts; auto-recover resident models when a worker reconnects.
- **Idle-pipeline self-heal:** every data-plane hop is fresh-reconnected at each generation's prefill
  if it has been idle (an idle TCP socket can go silently half-open — the write succeeds but the bytes
  never arrive — which otherwise stalls the first request after an idle gap until the generation
  timeout). Both the controller's connection to stage 0 and each worker's next-hop are freshened, so a
  model that sat loaded-but-unused replies immediately instead of appearing wedged.
- Observability: placement preview, per-load progress/ETA, fleet CPU/GPU/RAM + throughput + bandwidth,
  curl-able fleet logs; idle-gated multi-file self-update.
- **TP mesh keepalive:** the tensor-parallel all-reduce mesh used to work for one generation then
  stall ("peer rank stalled or closed") after a short idle gap between requests — an idle mesh socket
  going silently half-open. Rank 0 now pings the peers (a tiny round-trip that keeps both directions
  warm) whenever the mesh has been idle a few seconds, so TP stays alive across idle periods instead
  of needing a reload after the first request.

## Public release
- Central `config.json` (all hosts/ports + the self-update source; no addresses baked into code);
  credentials and internal-only artifacts scrubbed for open source.
- **Self-update pulls from the public GitHub repo's raw endpoint** (`update_repo`/`update_branch`) — no
  token of any kind, on the controller or any worker. `provision_worker.sh` clones from public GitHub.
